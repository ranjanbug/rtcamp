Step 1 :
Here is a sample script in Python to check if docker and docker-compose are installed on the system, and if not, install them:
This script uses the subprocess module to run system commands. It first checks if docker is installed by running the docker --version command. If the command returns a non-zero exit code, it means that docker is not installed, so the script installs it using the apt-get command.

Next, the script checks if docker-compose is installed by running the docker-compose --version command. If the command returns a non-zero exit code, it means that docker-compose is not installed, so the script installs it using the apt-get command.

Note that this script uses the apt-get command to install the packages, which is specific to the Ubuntu operating system. If you are using a different operating system, you will need to use the appropriate package manager to install the packages.


Step 2 :
Here is a sample script in Python to create a WordPress site using the latest WordPress version, and allowing the user to provide the site name as a command-line argument:

This script uses the argparse module to parse the command-line arguments. It defines the site_name argument, which is the name of the WordPress site to be created. It then extracts the site_name value from the command-line arguments and uses it to create the WordPress site.

To create the WordPress site, the script runs the docker-compose command to download the latest WordPress version, and then runs the wp command to create the WordPress configuration file with the specified site name.

To run this script, the user needs to have docker and docker-compose installed on their system. The user can provide the site name as a command-line argument when running the script, for example:

-> python create_wordpress_site.py my_site

Step 3 :
Here is a sample script in Python to create a LEMP stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP) running inside Docker containers using Docker Compose:

This script creates a file named docker-compose.yml that contains the configuration for the LEMP stack. It defines three services: nginx, php, and mysql. Each service uses a Docker image to run the corresponding component of the LEMP stack (Nginx, PHP, and MySQL). The services are connected to a common web network, which allows them to communicate with each other.

After creating the Docker Compose configuration file, the script runs the docker-compose build command to build the images for the services, and then runs the docker-compose up -d command to start the LEMP stack. This will create and start the Docker containers for the Nginx, PHP, and MySQL services, and the LEMP stack will be running inside these containers.

To run this script, the user needs to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on their system. The script also assumes that the user has created the required directories and configuration files for the LEMP stack, such as nginx/default.conf, nginx/log, nginx/html, php/app, and mysql/data. These directories and files should be placed in the same directory as the script.


Step 4 :
Here is a sample script in Python to create an entry in the /etc/hosts file for example.com pointing to localhost, assuming that the user has provided example.com as the site name:

This script uses the argparse module to parse the command-line arguments. It defines the site_name argument, which is the name of the site to create the /etc/hosts entry for. It then extracts the site_name value from the command-line arguments and uses it to create the /etc/hosts entry.

To create the /etc/hosts entry, the script opens the /etc/hosts file in append mode and writes the entry for the site in the following format: localhost site_name. This will add a new line to the /etc/hosts file with the specified site name and the localhost address.

To run this script, the user needs to provide the site name as a command-line argument when running the script, for example:

-> python create_hosts_entry.py example.com

This will create an entry in the /etc/hosts file for example.com pointing to localhost. Note that the user needs to have the appropriate permissions to write to the /etc/hosts file.


Step 5 :
Here is a sample script in Python to prompt the user to open example.com in a browser if the site is up and healthy:

This script uses the requests module to check if example.com is up and healthy. It sends a GET request to the site and checks the HTTP status code of the response. If the status code is 200, it means that the site is up and healthy, so the script prints a message prompting the user to open the site in a browser. If the status code is not 200, it means that there is an issue with the site, so the script prints an error message.

To run this script, the user needs to have the requests module installed on their system. The script also assumes that the user has set up example.com and it is accessible from the user's machine. When the script is run, if the site is up and healthy, it will print a message like this:

The site is up and healthy. Please open http://example.com in your browser.

If the site is not up and healthy, it will print a message like this:

The site is not up and healthy. Please check the site status.

Step 6 :

Here is a sample script in Python to add a subcommand to enable or disable a site (stopping or starting the Docker containers) using Docker Compose:

This script uses the argparse module to parse the command-line arguments. It defines the command argument, which is the subcommand to run (either enable or disable). It then extracts the command value from the command-line arguments and uses it to run the appropriate subcommand.

If the command is enable, the script runs the docker-compose up -d command to start the Docker containers, and prints a message indicating that the site is enabled. If the command is disable, the script runs the docker-compose stop command to stop the Docker containers, and prints a message indicating that the site is disabled. If the command is not enable or disable, the script prints an error message.

To run this script, the user needs to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on their system. The script also assumes that the user has created the Docker Compose configuration file and built the images for the containers. To run the script, the user needs to provide the subcommand as a command-line argument, for example:

-> python enable_disable_site.py enable

This will start the Docker containers for the site, enabling it. To disable the site, the user can run the script with the disable subcommand, for example:

-> python enable_disable_site.py disable

This will stop the Docker containers for the site, disabling it.


Step 7 :

Here is a sample script in Python to add a subcommand to delete a site (deleting the Docker containers and local files) using Docker Compose:

This script uses the argparse module to parse the command-line arguments. It defines the command argument, which is the subcommand to run (delete). It then extracts the command value from the command-line arguments and uses it to run the delete subcommand.

If the command is delete, the script runs the docker-compose down --rmi all --volumes command to delete the Docker containers and local files associated with the site. This will remove the containers, images, and volumes used by the site, effectively deleting it. The script then prints a message indicating that the site has been deleted. If the command is not delete, the script prints an error message.

To run this script, the user needs to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on their system. The script also assumes that the user has created the Docker Compose configuration file and built the images for the containers. To run the script, the user needs to provide the delete subcommand as a command-line argument, for example:

-> python delete_site.py delete

This will delete the Docker containers and local files for the site. Note that this operation cannot be undone, so the user should use it with caution.
